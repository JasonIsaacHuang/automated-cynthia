# Architecture
- Every mortgage provider (lender) offers a wide range of home loans (product) to their customers.
- Each product contains attributes that determine the characteristics of the product
- Each product itself may have variants which are slight differentiations from the base product, these will be more tailored towards different borrowing circumstances such as loan amount, or LVR
